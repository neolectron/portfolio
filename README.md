# My Portfolio

## GOAL

- This website is portfolio for my artworks.

- When I scroll down, images load in a beatiful animation using Motion.dev.
- When I click on an image, it opens in a modal with a larger view and some details about the artwork.

- You can close the modal by clicking on the X button, pressing ESC key, or by clicking outside the modal.
